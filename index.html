    <!-- USE OF VAR, LET, CONST -->
     <h1>var</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>redeclaring a variable inside a block will also redeclare the variable outside the block</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let have Global Scope</li>
        <li>var can be redeclared multiple times in the same scope. that's why the chances of error increases.</li>
     </ul>
     <!-- LET--------------- -->
     <h1>let</h1>
     <ul>
        <li>redeclaring a variable inside a block will not redeclare the variable outside the block</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let have Block Scope</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let must be Declared before use</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let cannot be accessed outside the block scope</li>
        <li>Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope</li>
     </ul>
     
     <h1>is var and let both are hoisted? what is the difference?</h1>
     <p>Yes, both are hoisted. The difference is var is hoisted and it assigns the value as "undefined". <br>
        In case of let, the variable is hoisted ( brought to the top of code) but it's value is not set as "undefined" (means not initialized as var)
     </p>
     <!-- CONST------------------- -->
      <h1>const</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>const is Block scoped</li>
        <li>const cannot be re-assigned in the same scope</li>
        <li>const must be assigned with a value when declared. no line break in allowed.</li>
        <li>it should be used for declaring :
            <ol>
                <li>A new array</li>
                <li>A new object</li>
                <li>A new Function</li>
                <li>A new RegExp</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>it dost not define a constant value. It defines a const reference to a value</li>
        <li>const value, array, object cannot be re-assigned. But we can change a const array and obj.</li>
        <li>You can change the elements of a const array, but u can not re-assign the array</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Operators and Operands</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.</li>
        <li>The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Assignment Operators</h1>
      <p>x += 5 </p>
      <p>means x = x + 5</p>
      <p>% means remainder. </p>
      <p>let x = 10;</p>
      <p>x %= 5; //means x= x/5, meaning x= 10/5, which has no remainder. so the answer would be 0 in this case.</p>
      <h1>Difference between Array and Object</h1>
      <p>Array elements are seperated by comma, written within square bracket.</p>
      <p>Objects properties are written as name:value pairs, seperated by commas, written within curly braces.</p>
